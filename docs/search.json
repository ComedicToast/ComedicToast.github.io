    "text": "Dissecting a Bad Visualization\nBelow is an example of a less-than-ideal visualization from the collection linked above. It comes to us from data provided for the Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 report by the Gallup World Poll:\n\n\nWhile there are certainly issues with this image, do your best to tell the story of this graph in words. That is, what is this graph telling you? What do you think the authors meant to convey with it?\n\nThe graph is telling me the amount of trust in vaccines that different countries have, with each country belonging to a specific global region. The general trend is that the global regions are ordered from highest trust to lowest trust from top to bottom (Asia, Middle East and North Africa, etc.). The authors likely meant to show the general trend in vaccine trust among countries within their respective global regions. The authors also wanted to highlight particular countries (typically the lower/higher trust ones within a particular global region) by providing their labels.\n\nList the variables that appear to be displayed in this visualization. Hint: Variables refer to columns in the data.\n\nThe variables are global region, country, and % of people who believe vaccines are safe. The y-axis on this graph appears to act as a way to separate the countries (which is a bit strange) and doesn’t have a particular variable attached to it.\n\nNow that you’re versed in the grammar of graphics (e.g., ggplot), list the aesthetics used and which variables are mapped to each.\n\nThe x-axis aesthetic is mapped to the variable % of people who believe vaccines are safe. The y-axis aesthetic technically isn’t mapped to anything, but the countries are separated across the y-axis. Another aesthetic is the separation of the plot into 7 regions (using group perhaps?), with the global region variable mapped to it.\n\nWhat type of graph would you call this? Meaning, what geom would you use to produce this plot?\n\nI would use geom_point to produce this plot. This is a dot graph/point graph.\n\nProvide at least four problems or changes that would improve this graph. Please format your changes as bullet points!\n\n\nRemove the legend on the bottom of the graph, as it isn’t needed due to the color separation and text already present\nI would add a label for the median bars to indicate the value of the median for each global region\nIf only some of the data points are going to be labeled, there needs to be a line connecting the point to the name, because sometimes it is quite hard to tell which label is associated with which dot\nI would consider separating each global region out into frames in a gif. That way, if it isn’t too crowded, each country could be labeled separately, and there would not be as much information to take in all at once"

In this class, we will exclusively make use of tools from the tidyverse suite of packages to perform our data cleaning and wrangling operations. If you are less familiar with these packages or it’s been some time since you used them, I would strongly recommend referencing the function documentation!\nFor these problems, we will continue to work with the mpg data frame, making various changes to the data to clean it up.\n\nThe fl variable describes the type of fuel for each car, with levels: p, r, e, d, and c. Do some research into what each of these labels mean! Then, use the if_else() function to create a new variable (fuel_type) with two levels: petrol (any car using petrolium-based gas) and alternative energy (any car not using petrolium-based gas).\n\n\n# premium and diesel and regular in petrol, electric and cng in alternative\ndfq11 &lt;-mpg %&gt;%\n  mutate(fuel_type = if_else(fl %in% c(\"p\", \"d\", \"r\"), \"petrol\", \"alternative energy\"))\ndfq11\n\n# A tibble: 234 × 12\n   manufacturer model      displ  year   cyl trans drv     cty   hwy fl    class\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 audi         a4           1.8  1999     4 auto… f        18    29 p     comp…\n 2 audi         a4           1.8  1999     4 manu… f        21    29 p     comp…\n 3 audi         a4           2    2008     4 manu… f        20    31 p     comp…\n 4 audi         a4           2    2008     4 auto… f        21    30 p     comp…\n 5 audi         a4           2.8  1999     6 auto… f        16    26 p     comp…\n 6 audi         a4           2.8  1999     6 manu… f        18    26 p     comp…\n 7 audi         a4           3.1  2008     6 auto… f        18    27 p     comp…\n 8 audi         a4 quattro   1.8  1999     4 manu… 4        18    26 p     comp…\n 9 audi         a4 quattro   1.8  1999     4 auto… 4        16    25 p     comp…\n10 audi         a4 quattro   2    2008     4 manu… 4        20    28 p     comp…\n# ℹ 224 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: fuel_type &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\nThe drv variable describes if the car has front drive (f), rear drive (r), or four wheel drive (4).
